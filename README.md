I'm a Machine Learning Scientist interested in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

## 💼 Projects

* [The LLM Course](https://github.com/mlabonne/llm-course): A popular curated list of resources to get into LLMs (>15k ⭐).
* [Hands-on GNNs](https://github.com/mlabonne/llm-course): My book about graph neural networks published by Packt (all the code is open source).
* [LLM AutoEval](https://github.com/mlabonne/llm-autoeval): Automatically evaluate your LLMs in Google Colab.

## 🤗 Models

* [Phixtral](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/phixtral-2x2_8): The first Mixture of Experts with phi-2 models.
* [Beyonder](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/Beyonder-4x7B-v2): Mixture of Experts with four excellent fine-tuned Mistral-7b models.
* [NeuralMarcoro14](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/NeuralMarcoro14-7B): The best general-purpose 7B model when it was released.
* [NeuralHermes](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/NeuralHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B): Most successful DPO fine-tuned version of OpenHermes when it was released.
